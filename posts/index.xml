      <description>This is how we dance.
December 2018 - Milonga Linda We were invited to perform at Milonga Linda in Ljubljana. This was our first performance in front of a tango-educated audience. The performance motivated us to practice more.
We were very nervous. We improvised everything&amp;mdash;nothing was set. I like the third song we danced the most:
 Anibal Troilo - El motivo  Our best dance was actually the additional song, where we dance with the performances from previous editions of Milonga Linda.</description>
