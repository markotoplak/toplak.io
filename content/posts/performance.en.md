This is how we dance.

December 2018 - Milonga Linda
-----------------------------

We were invited to perform at Milonga Linda in Ljubljana. This was our 
first performance in front of a tango-educated audience. The performance 
motivated us to practice more.

We were very nervous. We improvised everything---nothing was set.
I like the third song we danced the most:

- [Anibal Troilo - El motivo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTiSXGaSoFA)

Our best dance was actually the additional song, where we dance with 
the performances from previous editions of Milonga Linda. Having friends
around us helped us relax:

- [D'Arienzo - La bruja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hplTKYWMUGM)

And the first two songs:

1. [Di sarli - Sin ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zza6tXbAWTM)
2. [D'Arienzo - Yo me quedó con el tango (Susanita)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9pg61kJmo0)

Thank you for the recordings, [pvalveproduction](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHaB39BwcwYifcjEYbW85Q).

November 2015 - Beep
--------------------

We performed at this event because our friend
and mentor [Sanja](http://sanjasana.si), who was to perform there, got injured. We danced one song:

-  [Osmar Maderna - Merceditas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKgJ2IS53Ng)
