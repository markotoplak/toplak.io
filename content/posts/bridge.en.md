Three years ago I could not do a bridge. It did not seem hard,
but when I tried, I could not do it. I managed to lift
myself up for a few centimeters for an instant, but that was it.

That was years ago. Now I do it better. Video from January 2019:

I should have more weight over my hands. I will fix it.

 
Slowly getting better
---------------------

This exercise is part of the 
[GMB Integral Strength](https://gmb.io/is/) program. 
On average, I only do two minutes (4 series of half a minute) of it about 
every three days, but I also do other exercises for the core.
Of course, I began with an easier version.

My best in December 2016, after 1.5 months of practice.
I can only lift myself enough to put my head onto the floor.

After 0.6 years of practice I can get higher, but I can not do
it slowly. I can not control the speed on the way up or down:

After 1.6 years I have more control, but in the last few centimeters of
descent I still fall.

After 2 years I have better control:

What now? I will try to put more weight onto my hands, which will
also require more flexibility in my shoulders.
