Diego Ortega and Aldana Silveira. They are one of the few couples that I find magical. When I start watching them, I easily get lost in their videos. I do not have a complete answer on why I like them so much, but I am sure I am fascinated by how they connect steps. It is hard to see where their step finishes and the next one starts: they link them so well. And they do it differently each time so that it fits the steps and the music.

I know how hard it is because I have been working on more continuity in my dance for years. Yes, it obviously requires more control and power. Therefore, to me, a more interesting aspect is the intellectual understanding of it: to connect steps efficiently, I can not rely on the zero point.

With the zero point, I named a particular position with the weight solely on one foot, which many use for anchoring their movement, in other words, a position we are used to arriving in after the step and the position we start a new step from. (If you can not see it, congratulations!) It does not matter which position this is. It will not work, whichever it is, because the most efficient connection between two steps (typically, with different directions) will go through the same position. If I try to find my imaginary zero point between two steps, this cuts my dance into parts immediately. Goodbye, continuity! And if I hurry into it quickly, goodbye, dynamics. God help me, if then, in the zero point, I try squeezing my feet together!

The zero point is only a conceptual construct and not connected to actual movement efficiency. But do we need it in tango? Do we have to keep returning to the same spot? Quite a few teachers taught me to do just that. But later, I noticed that some couples dance differently, somehow softer. Much later, I finally found teachers who showed me that the zero point is not needed with a better understanding of coordination within a couple of and with more precise communication. Without it, I can make tango (at least for me) more interesting.

And there are probably many others whom the zero point concept frustrates.
