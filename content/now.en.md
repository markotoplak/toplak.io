I mainly:

- Program.
- Workout.
- Climb.
- Dance tango.
- Sleep.

I am trying to extend [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si),
a visual programming toolkit for data analysis, so that it will handle
[spectral](https://github.com/quasars/orange-spectroscopy) data and perhaps
also data from tomography. We call our project [Quasar](https://quasar.codes).

This semester I am an assistant for the 
Introduction to Data Mining course at the [Faculty of Computer and Information Science](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si) in Ljubljana.

Again, I do the
[GMB Integral Strength](https://gmb.io/is/) workout program.

Now I live in Slovenia. No more [Fontainebleau forest](/bleau/) for me. I do miss it. Instead, we go to the gym.
