I mainly:

- Program.
- Workout.
- Climb.
- Dance tango.
- Sleep.

During the week I walk to the [Soleil Synchrotron](https://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/), France,
where I am a post-doc. I am trying to extend [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si),
a visual programming toolkit for data analysis, so that it will handle
[spectral](https://github.com/quasars/orange-spectroscopy) data and perhaps
also data from tomography. We call our project [Quasar](https://quasar.codes).

If tango does not make me too tired, I follow the
[GMB Integral Strength](https://gmb.io/is/) workout program. 
Every day I [hang for 7 minutes](http://www.idoportal.com/blog/hanging). 
I started a week ago and it is already becoming easier.
When feeling courageous, I take a cold shower.

There is a wonderful place nearby: [Fontainebleau forest](/bleau/).
The forest, where pine trees grow on a sandy ground---it reminds me of the seaside---is
full of big rocks. We try to climb them once per week.

I go to afternoon milonga on Sunday (Dolce vita) regularly. I
avoid staying up late. We practice at home a lot.
