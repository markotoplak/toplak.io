I mainly:

- Take care of my 3-year-old son.
- Teach data analysis.
- Write computer programs.
- Dance argentine tango.

I am trying to extend [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si),
a visual programming toolkit for data analysis, so that it will handle
[spectral](https://github.com/quasars/orange-spectroscopy) data and perhaps
also data from tomography. We call our project [Quasar](https://quasar.codes).

This semester I am an assistant for two courses at the [Faculty of Computer and Information Science](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si) in Ljubljana:
(1) Introduction to data mining and (2) Machine learning for data science 1. I do not have much time to do anything else. There are a few bugs in Orange I already found in winter that are still waiting for me.

Again, I do the
[GMB Elements](https://gmb.io/e/) workout program.

I live in Ljubljana, Slovenia. We moved to a new place, 2 kilometers to the south. I just noticed I did not update this page for 5 (five!) years.
