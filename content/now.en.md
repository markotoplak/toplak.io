I mainly:

- Program.
- Workout.
- Climb.
- Dance tango.
- Sleep.

This week I am in Minsk for a [summer school](https://biospecnorway.github.io/biospec-summerschool/) and a [conference](https://biospecnorway.github.io/BioSpecMLC2019/), where I teach and present Orange/Quasar.

I am trying to extend [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si),
a visual programming toolkit for data analysis, so that it will handle
[spectral](https://github.com/quasars/orange-spectroscopy) data and perhaps
also data from tomography. We call our project [Quasar](https://quasar.codes).

I just started the
[GMB Rings 1](https://gmb.io/r1/) workout program. Even the simplest
exercises on rings are hard.

Now I live in Slovenia. No more [Fontainebleau forest](/bleau/) for me. I do miss it. Instead, we go climbing to crags in Å tajerska and to the gym.
