I mainly:

- Fix bugs.
- Workout.
- Practice tango.
- Climb.
- Sleep.

During the week I walk to the [Soleil Synchrotron](https://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/), France,
where I am a post-doc. I am trying to extend [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si),
a visual programming toolkit for data analysis, so that it will handle
[spectral](https://github.com/quasars/orange-spectroscopy) data and perhaps
also data from tomography. We call our project [Quasar](https://quasar.codes).

If I am not too tired because I did something else, I follow the
[GMB Integral Strength](https://gmb.io/is/) program. After the workouts I feel great. And hungry.
Always.

There is a wonderful place nearby that is world-famous for bouldering: Fontainebleau forest.
The forest, where pine trees grow on a sandy ground---it reminds me of the seaside---is
full of big rocks. We try to climb them once per week.

Before moving here I was looking forward to dancing tango in Paris, but I do not
go that often.
Returning home during the night just takes long (I avoid going to Paris by car).
I like the Sunday evening milonga, Dolce vita, the best.

We practice at home. Now we practice more, because we are performing on December 16 at
Milonga Linda in Ljubljana. Lately
I like practicing more than dancing at a milonga.

I am learning French. I take classes at Soleil and I watch the original Dragonball
series (in French).
