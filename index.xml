      <description>In tango we dance to&amp;mdash;exaggerating a bit&amp;mdash;to the same 25 songs. Still, every milonga feels different. Selection of music, order of songs and their combinations, is very important. If it is good, everything flows better. Dancers are more peaceful, but also more creative. The whole dancefloor is moving faster, but there are less crashes. People dance more with strangers. Whenever my favorite DJ (Andres Molina) plays, it feels as if I dance better.</description>

      <description>Computer geek I started programming in the last years of primary school. Programming was something only the coolest people did. For some years I tried to learn Pascal, but I only managed to copy examples from the book. I also built web pages, but that was not real programming. I only started think like a programmer when I was forced to do it. I wanted to host an IRC bot on a VAX/VMS server.</description>

      <description>I mainly:
 Fix bugs. Workout. Practice tango. Climb. Sleep.  During the week I walk to the Soleil Synchrotron, France, where I am a post-doc. I am trying to extend Orange, a visual programming toolkit for data analysis, so that it will handle spectral data and perhaps also data from tomography. We call our project Quasar.
If I am not too tired because I did something else, I follow the GMB Integral Strength program.</description>
