      <description>Some years ago two girls came to the Carmencita milonga in Ljubljana. I saw them for the first time. I thought they were beginners. For the first hour they were just sitting in a corner and observing the milonga. Then I invited one of them to dance.
When we started dancing, something felt odd. She was a tiny girl, but, when we were dancing, she seemed so big! I knew exactly what she was doing with her body: through our embrace I felt her feet!</description>

      <description>I started dancing tango because I liked the music. Now I occasionally play it at milongas. On this page:

      <title>Fontainebleau for beginner climbers</title>

      <description>Some say that you should not go to Fontainebleau if you are not a high level climber. I strongly disagree: also for beginners, it is one of the best climbing spots. I have not found such diverse problems at a single spot anywhere else.
The Fontainebleau forest is covered with sandstone boulders, where generations of Parisians practised for long climbs in the Alps. Afterwards, bouldering developed as an independent activity.</description>

      <description>Three years ago I could not do a bridge. It did not seem hard, but when I tried, I could not do it. I managed to lift myself up for a few centimeters for an instant, but that was it.
That was years ago. Now I do it better. Video from January 2019:
[Bridge, January 2019, video](/bridge/201901.s.mp4)  I should have more weight over my hands. I will fix it.</description>

      <title>Our tango performances</title>

      <description>This is how we dance.
December 2018 - Milonga Linda We were invited to perform at Milonga Linda in Ljubljana. This was our first performance in front of a tango-educated audience. The performance motivated us to practice more.
We were very nervous. We improvised everything&amp;mdash;nothing was set. I like the third song we danced the most:
 Anibal Troilo - El motivo  Our best dance was actually the additional song, where we dance with the performances from previous editions of Milonga Linda.</description>

      <description>Computer geek I started programming in the last years of primary school. Programming was something only the coolest people did. For some years I tried to learn Pascal, but I only managed to copy examples from the book. I also built web pages, but that was not real programming. I only started think like a programmer when I was forced to do it. I wanted to host an IRC bot on a VAX/VMS server.</description>

      <description>I mainly:
 Program. Workout. Climb. Dance tango. Sleep.  I am trying to extend Orange, a visual programming toolkit for data analysis, so that it will handle spectral data and perhaps also data from tomography. We call our project Quasar.
This semester I am an assistant for the Introduction to Data Mining course at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana.
Again, I do the GMB Integral Strength workout program.</description>
